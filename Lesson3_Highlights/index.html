            <p class="lead">Version control systems provide one main repository for all project files. Team members check files out, make changes, and then check them back in. They automatically note who changed the files (revision history) when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and merge changes to the same file. There are many benefits to Version Control Systems. Files cannot be overwritten, there is a common repository that holds all the latest files, people can work on the same files simultaneously without conflict, they allow you to revert back to an older version of the file/project if needed, and even if you don’t work with a team, version control system will backup files so that you won’t lose your work or have to start a project over! There are two types of repositories.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. GIT is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple work flows. The reasons to use get are many. Every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine, everything is local, so you can work offline, there is no single point of failure, processes run much faster, and GIT will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository.</p>
